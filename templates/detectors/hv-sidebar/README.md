HV Sidebar
==========

The Dashboard's HV sidebar provides reporting and control for HV cells both on the detector pages, and on the HV summary page. It relies on the same ODB and dataStore structures as the HV summary page, [documented here](https://github.com/GRIFFINCollaboration/griffin-dashboard/blob/gh-pages/templates/hv-monitor/README.md).
