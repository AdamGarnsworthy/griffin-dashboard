Detector Monitors
==================

The Dashboard provides skeuomorphic representations of all detectors involved in the current experiment, to visualize their HV, ADC thresholds, and requested and accepted trigger rates, as well as expose controls for many HV and ADC parameters.

## Maintenance Requirements

#### ODB Structures

 - `/DAQ` directory, as outlined in the [DAQ docs](https://github.com/BillMills/griffin-dashboard/tree/gh-pages/templates/daq-monitor#odb-structures).
 - '/Equipment/HV-*' directories, as outlined in the [HV docs](https://github.com/BillMills/griffin-dashboard/tree/gh-pages/templates/hv-monitor#odb-structures).

#### External APIs

 - **ADC API**, as outlined in the [ADC docs]().
