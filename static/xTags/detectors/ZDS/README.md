###ZDS

`<detector-ZDS>` inherits all the standard functionality from `xDetectorTemplate` and `setupDetector`.  It is the absolute simplest detector of them all, and a good place to start from when figuring out how to build your own xDetector.

####Attributes
 - `MIDAS`: host:port of the MIDAS experiment the HV frontends for this detector are living at.
