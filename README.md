=============

MarkII is an exploratory reengineering of the griffin.js project, taking advantage of modern JavaScript frameworks like x-tags and paper.js to simplify details and abstract plumbing.

MarkII is distributed under the MIT license, as are paper.js and x-tags, the giants upon whose shoulders we stand.
